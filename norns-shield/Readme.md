### Bamboo Enclosure for Norns Shield

#### Laser cutting
SVG files are provided for laser cutting 3mm bamboo sheets.
The clear window should be cut from clear 3mm acrylic.

**IMPORTANT:** SVG scaling can change between software programs. Make sure your dimensions are correct before laser cutting. Try printing the base layer onto paper and check that it fits.

**Cut colour is blue: #0000FF**  
**Stroke width for cuts is 0.025mm.** This is the width required by the laser cutter I use. (It's what makes the graphics a bit faint looking when editing.)

#### Assembly notes
Look at the provided images to see how the layers fit together. This is probably clearest in the 3D rendered images.

It's recommended to glue the layers together gradually, in matching layers, working upwards from the base.
The smaller parts can be glued together separately in one go. Take care to align everything correctly.
Leave the top layer unglued to allow the fitting of electronics. The top can be glued on once the electronics have been fitted.

Do the bulk of any sanding before fitting the electronics.

This design was made to fit onto available bamboo scraps and is therefore about the smallest it could possibly be in terms of width and length.
For that reason, when assembling, it's quite a tight fit. You will have to put the Raspberry Pi into the case first by itself, fitting the stand-offs, then add the Norns shield afterwards.

Alternatively you could alter the design to add a few mm length and width to the case. That should be sufficient to allow the insertion of the Pi and the Shield together.

**Acrylic window**  
Fit the acryclic window to the top bamboo layer before gluing the bamboo in place.
After cutting out, the acrylic should be slightly too large for the slot in the bamboo. This is intentional to ensure a tight fit. The edges of the acrylic window should be sanded down carefully (*and evenly!*) until it can almost fit.
At this point sand the edges at a very slight angle so that the leading edge of the acrylic fits into the rectangular gap in the bamboo. Push in carefully until the window is flush with the bamboo.

It's recommended that you cut a few of these windows as it's good to have backups in case of uneven sanding, scratches, etc.
